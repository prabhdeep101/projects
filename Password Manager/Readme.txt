Hey,
I am Prabhdeep and welcome to the Password Manager. 
This is a pretty basic project using encryption and file handling.

How to use: 

1. The prompt asks if you want to add or view passwords. Just type in add/view or q to quit.
2. If you type in view, you can see the existing passwords through the manager that you wont be able to see if you open the text file.
3. Comments have been addded for most of the things that need explanation, if still something is unclear feel free to ask.

Might add some more functionality like deleting the passwords or having a master password to access all the passwords in the future.

Have fun with the Passwoord Manager.
Cheers
Prabh
